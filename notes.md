Constraints of the Chatapp
- Multiple users can join in the chatroom
- Notification when a new user joins

Simnplest possible POC:
- 2 users
- Each user can see three components:
    - One text box which should contain their user name
    - A msg history of all msgs that have been send since the user has been online
    - A msg box to write and send a msg (with "send" button)
- When one writes a msg and clicks "send", it appears in the history of both


Features to add on top of that:
- Lots of cool stuff!!! :tada:
